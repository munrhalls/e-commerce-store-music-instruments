CORE PURPOSE IS AUTOMATED PROBLEM-PLACE SEARCH. TAKE OUT THE "WHERE IS IT" OUT OF THE EQUATION.

FOR ANY ISSUE, YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK FOR:
WHERE IT STARTS,
AT WHAT FEATURE,
AT WHICH COMPONENT,
AT WHAT "STOPPED WORKING LIKE IT SHOULD" PLACE EXACTLY.

So:

- any issue = tests can pinpoint where is it instantly
- updates = easier to see what exact place doesn't work after update

No need to search for where the bug happens. No need to search for which exact place doesn't work after update.
