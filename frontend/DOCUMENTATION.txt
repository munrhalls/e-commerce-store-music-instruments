VERSION REQUIREMENTS:
- (!!!) node version v18.13.0 or higher


IN SIMPLE TERMS, HOW THE CLIENT APP WORKS:

Initial Load:

  User visits the app.
  Angular app makes an API request to the SSR server.
  SSR server generates HTML with initial data.
  SSR server sends HTML to the browser.
  Browser parses and displays the initial content.

Subsequent Requests:
  User interacts with the app (clicks, navigates).
  Angular app handles everything directly.
  Angular fetches data through API calls if needed.
  Nginx serves static assets (scripts, styles) efficiently.
  This achieves both SEO benefits from initial SSR and performance gains from Nginx serving most assets.

COLORS PALETTE:

#f5cd8b / rgba(245,205,139,255) - light golden font
#640101 crimson fit color for font
#a50101 lighter crimson
#413f3f dark grey background for form views:

HTML SELECTORS:
- as much native's (button, etc.) as possible
- as little classes as possible
- if full feature, use short name (e.g. search)
- if not feature, prefix that name (e.g. btn-search)

ORDER OF CSS PROPERTIES:
- From "FURTHEST FROM ELEMENT" to "ELEMENT CENTER"
- Don't take it literally
- But try to generally write in order:
- a) display, positioning etc.
- b) margin padding borders etc.
- c) heights widths max min heights etc.
- d) internals font color bg etc.

- THIS ORDER HAS USEFUL EFFECTS, OTHER THAN JUST CLARITY:
    - e.g., if you need to push one element from another, always choose to do so using the "FURTHER FROM ELEMENT" guideline
    - need icon pushed from text? do it in the containing element if it makes sense

ANGULAR 16 -> 17 REQUIREMENTS:
  - DOCS 16 -> 17: https://update.angular.io/?l=3&v=16.0-17.0
  - node version v18.13.0 or higher
  - TS 5.2 or higher
  - Angular v16 supports Zone.js version 0.14.x or later.
  - Make sure you configure setupTestingRouter, canceledNavigationResolution, paramsInheritanceStrategy, titleStrategy, urlUpdateStrategy, urlHandlingStrategy, and malformedUriErrorHandler in provideRouter or RouterModule.forRoot since these properties are now not part of the Router's public API
  - Handle URL parsing errors in the UrlSerializer.parse instead of malformedUriErrorHandler because it's now part of the public API surface.
  - You may need to adjust your router configuration to prevent infinite redirects after absolute redirects. In v17 we no longer prevent additional redirects after absolute redirects.
  - Change references to AnimationDriver.NOOP to use NoopAnimationDriver because AnimationDriver.NOOP is now deprecated.
  - You may need to adjust the equality check for NgSwitch because now it defaults to stricter check with === instead of ==. Angular will log a warning message for the usages where you'd need to provide an adjustment.
  - If you want the child routes of loadComponent routes to inherit data from their parent specify the paramsInheritanceStrategy to always, which in v17 is now set to emptyOnly.
  - If you want the child routes of loadComponent routes to inherit data from their parent specify the paramsInheritanceStrategy to always, which in v17 is now set to emptyOnly. !!!
