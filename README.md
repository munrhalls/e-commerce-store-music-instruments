WHAT IS THIS:
Fictional e-commerce store that sells high quality, used watches.
Built using MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, Express for backend, and Angular for frontend.
This is a solo project to learn from, build and put on my web developer's portfolio.

WHAT DO YOU GET FROM THIS:
Idea of what I can do, in terms of building a real-world, advanced web development project, such as a full stack e-commerce store.
Idea of how someone like this can help YOUR PROJECT for YOUR TEAM for YOUR COMPANY.

HOW DO YOU GET IT:

See the OUTCOME PRODUCT, fictional e-commerce store live: //LINK HERE WHEN I HOST IT//

Look at SOURCE CODE:

- how I've organized the project
- how I've built a fullstack app using MEAN stack, starting from the backend and REST API

List of FEATURE-TASKS realized:
For starters, pre-development:

- use version control (git),
- carefully yet efficiently formulate core idea & design for outcome product (phone version, desktop version),
- formulate general idea of development process tasks & timelines in https://kanbanflow.com to manage this solo-project
- follow jira-like process (kanban in this case) to oversee & manage myself about delays, getting stuck, missing timelines, blockers etc.

  Development:

1. set up backend using MongoDB Cloud storage, Mongoose
2. build REST API using Node, Express
3. handle REST API Errors & Validation using Mongoose / Express middleware
4. TEST API requests using client (Thunder) to write & run the collection of TESTS for ALL ENDPOINTS; export and DOCUMENT the TEST

////

DOCUMENTATION:

1. TESTS (all are in the /tests) folder:

- REST API tests: exported thunder collection (CRUD + INTENTIONALLY BAD REQUESTS )

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
