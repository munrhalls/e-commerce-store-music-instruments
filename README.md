Large-scale, fullstack fictional e-commerce store application for my portfolio.

- GraphQL querying for server-client request-response cycle,
- Angular Frontend,
- Backend with MongoDB/Mongoose for database, Node.js runtime,
  Fastify + Typescript for server, and GraphQL for server-client

BACKEND:

- Backend tests: <...>
- MongoDB, Mongoose for database & querying
- Fastify for server (framework similar to express but much faster, more modern, with decent typescript support, simply better)
- Node.js for server runtime (single threaded, event-loop based, faster than multi-threaded runtime's)

FRONTEND:

- Frontend tests: Karma/Jasmine (Angular, built-in's)
- Angular, with module splitting, lazy-loading and Angular routing

Features:

- RWD covers all device sizes
