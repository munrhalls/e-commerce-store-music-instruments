RECURSIVE DATA+HTML SOLUTION IN ANGULAR


CATEGORIES

categories contains categories-list

categories-list receives data for [children] property


CATEGORIES-LIST

categories-list checks if children are present

categories-list loops over children, passes each child to categories-item


CATEGORIES-ITEM

receives categories-item

presents its content (individual category name + individualÂ category interface)

categories

passes its children to categories-list


Summary:

categories-list checks if [children] are > 0 == recursion STOP condition

children are first passed from categories component, and then, from categories-item component

the key to recursion is understanding that categories-item contains categories-list inside of itself

categories-item 1) presents its content, and then 2) starts new loop over its children by passing its children to categories-list
